# Scala Tooling Working Group Elections

The following rules shall govern the elections to Scala Tooling working groups.

1. An election will be held to determine the members of the Scala LSP Working
   Group (LSP-WG).

2. The election will be conducted by a presiding officer who will dictate the
   proceedings.

3. The election will select up to nine members for the working group.

4. Any individual is eligible to stand as a candidate. Corporations and other
   organizations are not eligible, but elected members may represent an
   organization.

5. Candidates must be nominated and seconded by two distinct individuals, in
   the form of a pull-request to the [scalacenter/tooling-working-groups
   repository](https://github.com/scalacenter/tooling-working-groups).

6. Candidates cannot nominate or second themselves.

7. Nominations may be received from the candidate, the proposer or the
   seconder, but require explicit approval by all three before merging.

8. Candidates should declare in their nomination any affiliations with
   commercial and other organizations involved in the Scala Community.

9. The presiding officer reserves the right to refuse any nomination if it is
   incomplete or in any other way deficient.

10. The deadline for completed nominations is 12pm UTC on 28 February 2018. Any
    pull requests received after this time will not be accepted.

11. At least two individuals should be members of both LSP-WG and STP-WG.

12. At least one member of LSP-WG should be a representative of the Scala
    Center, and no more than one third of the members (rounded to the nearest
    integer) should be affiliated with the Scala Center or EPFL.

13. If any round of selection could result in a candidate affiliated with the
    Scala Center or EPFL being elected to a working group such that the
    preceding constraint is violated, then those candidates shall be excluded
    from that round of selection.

14. The election serves to select the initial members of the working group,
    and defers subsequent decisions on membership and other matters to the
    working groups themselves.

15. The election will take place online starting at 6pm UTC on 28 February
    2018, and will be conducted by a presiding officer over several rounds of
    selection to elect members of both groups. Electors should be present in
    the [Scala Tooling Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/scala/tooling-contrib)
    at this time to receive instructions on how to vote.

16. Each round of selection will elect one individual to the LSP working group.

17. Any individual will be eligible to vote no more than once. Uniqueness of
    electors will be determined by Google account. Electors will be required
    to have a Google account.

18. Candidates are permitted to vote in the election.

19. Any elected candidate will not be a candidate in subsequent rounds of
    selection.

20. A candidate may withdraw from the election at any point by notifying the
    presiding officer.

21. The first round of selection will elect one individual to the LSP-WG from
    the subset of candidates standing who are already members of the STP-WG.

22. If, in the aforecited round, no suitable candidate is standing for
    election, then no candidate shall be selected in that round, and subsequent
    rounds will continue as described.

23. If, after the first round of selection, the LSP working group includes no
    members representing the Scala Center, one round will be held to elect one
    candidate from the subset of candidates representing the Scala Center.
    
24. If only one candidate is standing for election in any of the aforesaid
    rounds of voting then she or he will be appointed without a vote.

25. A proxy candidate called "Nobody else" will additionally stand in rounds of
    voting for the seventh and subsequent members of each group.

26. A number of subsequent rounds of selection will proceed to elect members
    until either the maximum of nine members is reached for that group, or
    "Nobody else" is selected.

27. Every round of selection shall select the candidate with the most
    first-preference votes. Upon selection, the selected candidate will be
    removed from subsequent rounds, and their electors' preference orders
    renumbered to reflect their removal.

28. The rounds of selection shall be carried out one after the other, with
    each member announced as they are selected.

29. If any round results in a draw, both candidates will be selected during
    that round.

30. Anonymized voting data for each round shall be made available automatically
    to every candidate, and to anyone else on request.

31. In the event that an exceptional circumstance should arise which is not
    covered by these articles, the presiding officer shall decide upon an
    appropriate course of action.

32. Any questions regarding these rules should be directed to Jon Pretty by
    email, to jon.pretty@propensive.com.

33. We reserve the right to amend or change these rules up to 6pm on 28
    February.
