## Qualifications and Experience

- Tech lead of Lightbend Tooling team.
- Maintainer of sbt. Worked on [sbt server][1] that is part of sbt 1.1.0.

## Affiliations

## Working Groups

This candidate is nominated as a candidate to the LSP Working Group (LSP-WG).

## Proposition

sbt has the full knowledge of the build (source, Zinc, libraries, tests),
and the feature can be enriched by the ecosystem of plugins that are available.
However, there's a growing demand for richer development integration
(code navigation, tab completion etc). LSP can be an intersection between sbt and frontend editors
that can enable such features.
