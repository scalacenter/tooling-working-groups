# Making a nomination

To make a nomination to one of the working groups, please copy the
`template.md` file in the `nominations` directory to a file called
`firstname_lastname.md`, and edit its contents appropriately.

Create a new pull-request containing just this new file. Nominations require a
proposer and a seconder, and any nominated candidate will be asked to confirm
their willingness to stand for election to the working groups before any pull
request is merged. The "Proposition" part of the nomination is optional, and
may be refined in subsequent pull requests.

Anyone may nominate or second up to three candidates to either or both working
groups.

The deadline for nominations will be 12pm GMT on Wednesday, 28 February.
